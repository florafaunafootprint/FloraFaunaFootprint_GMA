It has been introduced to other continents, often in warmer climates, where it has naturalized in certain areas.</td></tr><tr><td>Common cocklebur</td><td>Xanthium orientale</td><td>Annual weed</td><td>Exposed slopes, wet lands, moist place, irrigation channels</td><td>Indigenous to South America's tropical and subtropical regions. It has spread extensively beyond its native range, and is now found across several continents including Asia, Europe, and parts of Africa.</td></tr><tr><td>Common purslane</td><td>Portulaca oleracea</td><td>Perennial or annual weed</td><td>Fields, waste ground, roadside verges, cultivated ground, seasides</td><td>A wide native range, consisting of most of the African continent, much of the Middle East and some southern European countries. It has been naturalized almost all over the rest of the world.</td></tr><tr><td>Common sunflower</td><td>Helianthus annuus</td><td>Annual herb</td><td>Plains</td><td>Native to the United States and Mexico, where it grows in prairies and open areas. This plant now has a near global distribution due to its popularity in cultivation.</td></tr><tr><td>Dallis grass</td><td>Paspalum dilatatum</td><td>Perennial weed</td><td>Loamy disturbed soils, roadsides, fields, waste places, moist fields or woods</td><td>Originating in South America, it has spread to various regions, often thriving in temperate climates. It is now found in parts of Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas, evidencing a broad introduced range.</td></tr><tr><td>Elephant bush</td><td>Portulacaria afra</td><td>Perennial succulent and shrub</td><td>Thicket, Bushveld, Dry river valleys</td><td>Native to the south and east coasts of Africa, where it grows along rocky outcrops and dry slopes. It has been introduced in Sicily. It is widely cultivated as a houseplant and, in frost-free regions that include the US southwest, for outdoor landscaping.</td></tr><tr><td>Glory bower</td><td>Volkameria inermis</td><td>Perennial tree, vine, and shrub (Its evergreen branches can take the form of a bush or a climber.)</td><td>Coasts, edges of mangrove forests, saline marshes, swamps, tidal mud</td><td>Native to tropical regions of South, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands, thriving in areas with warm climates. It has been introduced and naturalized in parts of North Africa and South Asia.</td></tr><tr><td>Green amaranth</td><td>Amaranthus viridis</td><td>Annual weed</td><td>Waste ground, roadsides</td><td>A widespread presence, being native to the tropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in a variety of environments. Beyond its native range, green amaranth has been introduced to several continents including Africa, Asia, Europe, and Oceania, indicating its adaptability to diverse climates and conditions.</td></tr><tr><td>Kikuyu grass</td><td>Cenchrus clandestinus</td><td>Perennial grass</td><td>In dry and mesic habitats</td><td>Native to parts of Eastern Africa, has a significant presence across multiple continents, including Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Oceania.
